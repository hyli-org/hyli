# Contributing

We are an open-source project and we welcome contributions.

We’re always happy to talk and answer questions and remarks in [our Telegram group](https://t.me/hyli_org). Please discuss major changes with us in an issue before submitting a PR.

## **Guidelines**

- Keep PRs focused and well-documented.
- Follow our existing structure and style.
- Keep conversations focused, useful, and respectful.
- Use a [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) at the beginning of your PR title.

## **What kinds of contributions are welcome**

We welcome contributions that:

* Add meaningful features or improvements.
* Fix actual bugs.
* Improve documentation in a way that clarifies usage or architecture.
* Enhance developer experience or maintainability in a justified way.

Before submitting, consider whether your contribution **adds real value to the project**. If you're not sure, open a discussion first!

## ❌ What we generally **do not merge**

To preserve maintainability and reviewer time, we usually **reject PRs** that:

* Only fix small typos that don’t affect comprehension or usage.
* Bump versions of dependencies without a clear justification.
* Reformat code without prior discussion or configuration alignment.
* Change variable names or code style without functional impact.
* Target files that are auto-generated or not maintained manually.

If your PR falls into one of these categories and does not stem from an ongoing discussion or open issue, it is likely to be closed without further review.

## Payments

**We do not provide financial rewards for contributions.**

The exception is online hackathons with OnlyDust: [find all of these issues in our Hackathons repository](https://github.com/hyli-org/hackathons). These issues are usually tagged for a specific event.
